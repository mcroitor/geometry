# Geometry primitives library

This library defines geometry primitives, such as _point_, _cut_, _line_, _vector_
in N-dimensional space. All primitives is defined in mc::geometry namespace.

* [point class description](https://github.com/mcroitor/geometry/docs/point.md)
* [vector class description](https://github.com/mcroitor/geometry/docs/vector.md)
* [line class description](https://github.com/mcroitor/geometry/docs/line.md)
* [cut class description](https://github.com/mcroitor/geometry/docs/cut.md)

It is very specific library, will be rewritten using linear spaces.
